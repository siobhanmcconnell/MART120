    <h3>Favorite Story</h3>
    <p>Wabi Sabi, a little cat in Kyoto, Japan, has never thought about her name, until friends visiting from another land ask what it means.
       <br>
        At last, the master
        <br> 
        says, "That's hard to explain." And
        <br> 
        that is all she says
        <br>
        The curious Wabi Sabi then sets out on an adventure to discover the true meaning of her name.
